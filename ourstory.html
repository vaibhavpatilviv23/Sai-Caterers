            <br>
            <p>29 years ago, in my 20's I started Sai Caterers with no profit no loss. We had our first catering order on 10 Dec 1992, since then we have been spicing up the culinary
                world with vegetarian good. We started off intially by serviing our clients Indian-vegetarian delights in the most authentic preparation thus winning their hearts. From these 
                golden times, we have come a long way. However, the authenticity has stayed on.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>We have been working on new techniques to improve our service quality despite no single complaints from our clients. 
                
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>Today the second generation of Sai Caterers is taking its leagacy further with the same passion and commitment. 
                New cuisines from around the world have been added, but authen has been never compromised for novelty.
                At Sai Caterers, we go the distance in our quest for getting it just right. just the way it's meant to be.
